# 🏥 Medical Image Denoising with Deep Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for denoising medical images using deep learning techniques. The goal is to enhance image quality by removing noise, which is crucial for better diagnosis and analysis in medical imaging.

## 📘 Notebook

- **File**: `Medical_denoising.ipynb`
- **Purpose**: Applies deep learning models to reduce noise in medical images (e.g., CT scans, MRI).
- **Frameworks Used**: TensorFlow / Keras / NumPy / Matplotlib

## 🧠 Key Features

- Preprocessing of noisy medical images
- Construction and training of a convolutional neural network (CNN)
- Visualization of denoising results
- Evaluation using image quality metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM)

## 🖼️ Example Outputs

The notebook includes before/after denoising visualizations, showcasing the model’s effectiveness.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages:  

pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow scikit-image

````

### Running the Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook Medical_denoising.ipynb
````

Then run all cells to train the model and view denoising results.

## 🧪 Dataset

The notebook assumes access to a dataset of noisy and clean medical images. If no dataset is included, you'll need to provide one. Common formats include `.png`, `.jpg`, or `.nii.gz`.

## 📊 Evaluation

The model is evaluated using:

* **PSNR** (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
* **SSIM** (Structural Similarity Index)

These metrics help assess the visual quality and structural preservation of the denoised images.
